# Overshooting top
The goal is to find overshooting top on satellite IR images with Mask RCNN [1]. The data for training was created using the Bedk–∞ algorithm [2], after which it was checked manually (can share upon request). Results published in [3].

## Command line Usage
Train a new model starting from pre-trained COCO weights using `train` dataset 
```
python3 storm.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weight=coco
```

Resume training a model that you had trained earlier
```
python3 storm.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --weights=last
```

Generate masks with `test` images
```
python3 storm.py detect  --dataset=/path/to/dataset  --subset=test --weight=last
```
